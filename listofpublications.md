|ISCA 2014| A low power and reliable charge pump design for Phase Change Memories |  [link](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6853222/) | Emerging nonvolatile memory technologies (NVRAM) promise the performance of DRAM with the persistence of disk. However, constraining NVRAM write order, necessary to ensure recovery correctness, limits NVRAM write concurrency and degrades throughput. We require new memory interfaces to minimally describe write constraints and allow high performance and high concurrency data structures. These goals strongly resemble memory consistency. Whereas memory consistency concerns the order that memory operations are observed between numerous processors, persistent memory systems must constrain the order that writes occur with respect to failure. We introduce memory persistency, a new approach to designing persistent memory interfaces, building on memory consistency. Similar to memory consistency, memory persistency models may be relaxed to improve performance. We describe the design space of memory persistency and desirable features that such a memory system requires. Finally, we introduce several memory persistency models and evaluate their ability to expose NVRAM write concurrency using two implementations of a persistent queue. Our results show that relaxed persistency models accelerate system throughput 30-fold by reducing NVRAM write constraints.|
|ISCA 2017|Viyojit: Decoupling battery and DRAM capacities for battery-backed DRAM|[link] (https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8192506/)|Non-Volatile Memories (NVMs) can significantly improve the performance of data-intensive applications. A popular form of NVM is Battery-backed DRAM, which is available and in use today with DRAMs latency and without the endurance problems of emerging NVM technologies. Modern servers can be provisioned with up-to 4 TB of DRAM, and provisioning battery backup to write out such large memories is hard because of the large battery sizes and the added hardware and cooling costs. We present Viyojit, a system that exploits the skew in write working sets of applications to provision substantially smaller batteries while still ensuring durability for the entire DRAM capacity. Viyojit achieves this by bounding the number of dirty pages in DRAM based on the provisioned battery capacity and proactively writing out infrequently written pages to an SSD. Even for write-heavy workloads with less skew than we observe in analysis of real data center traces, Viyojit reduces the required battery capacity to 11% of the original size, with a performance overhead of 7-25%. Thus, Viyojit frees battery-backed DRAM from stunted growth of battery capacities and enables servers with terabytes of battery-backed DRAM.|
|ISCA 2018| 2B-SSD: The Case for Dual, Byte- and Block-Addressable Solid-State Drives |[link](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8416845/)|Performance critical transaction and storage systems require fast persistence of write data. Typically, a non-volatile RAM (NVRAM) is employed on the datapath to the permanent storage, to temporarily and quickly store write data before the system acknowledges the write request. NVRAM is commonly implemented with battery-backed DRAM. Unfortunately, battery-backed DRAM is small and costly, and occupies a precious DIMM slot. In this paper, we make a case for dual, byte- and block-addressable solid-state drive (2B-SSD), a novel NAND flash SSD architecture designed to offer a dual view of byte addressability and traditional block addressability at the same time. Unlike a conventional storage device, 2B-SSD allows accessing the same file with two independent byte- and block-I/O paths. It controls the data transfer between its internal DRAM and NAND flash memory through an intuitive software interface, and manages the mapping of the two address spaces. 2B-SSD realizes a wholly different way and speed of accessing files on a storage device; applications can access them directly using memory-mapped I/O, and moreover write with a DRAM-like latency. To quantify the benefits of 2B-SSD, we modified logging subsystems of major database engines to store log records directly on it without buffering them in the host memory. When running popular workloads, we measured throughput gains in the range of 1.2X and 2.8X with no risk of data loss.|
